The cover page, the block diagram, the schematics design notes and the pcb manufacturing notes were taken from the original design. The schematics library, pcb library, schematics, pcb design and release documentation were made according to what is shown in the course "Learn to design your own boards". (I wanted to repeat the pcb design steps shown by a professional from start to finish to learn pcb design best practices and better estimate the time it takes to develop a pcb with all the documentation for manufacturing)
